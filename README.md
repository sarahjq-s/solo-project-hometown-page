# solo-project-hometown-page

ðŸ‘‹Hi everyone! I've completed my first Solo Project: Hometown Homepage. This project was to showcase what I learned with building a website using HTML and CSS. 
In this project, I was also introduced to Figma and how to utilize it to design a website.

Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>âœ… use classes</li>
  <li>âœ… use flexbox</li>
  <li>âœ… add a background-image</li>
  <li>âœ… use the provided color palette</li>
</ul>

While working on this project, I ran into some challenges with flexbox. ðŸ˜µ I'm still struggling with the concept especially aligning elements horizontally vs vertically but I'm slowly understanding it more. The challenges I faced and how I overcame them:

ðŸŽ­ Activities section - I was challenged to make a three column section for the top 3 activities. I figured how to do it by setting up a div for each activity and then placing them inside a div, flex container, to display and align them accordingly.

ðŸ§‘ Guide section - It was not hard to make the card but formatting the texts was ðŸ˜“. I learned more about using the flex-direction: column and align the texts vertically. Once I figured that out, I used the justify-content to space out the texts. I tried out between the space-between and space-evenly and made final adjustements using the margin property.
