# solo-project-hometown-page

👋Hi everyone! I've completed my first Solo Project: Hometown Homepage at Scrimba. 🎉 This project was to showcase what I learned with building a website using HTML and CSS. 
In this project, I was also introduced to Figma and how to utilize it to design a website.

Live preview: [Solo Project: Hometown Page](https://classy-faloodeh-ed7574.netlify.app/)

Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>✅ use classes</li>
  <li>✅ use flexbox</li>
  <li>✅ add a background-image</li>
  <li>✅ use the provided color palette</li>
</ul>

While working on this project, I ran into some challenges with flexbox. 😵 I'm still struggling with the concept especially aligning elements horizontally vs vertically but I'm slowly understanding it more. The challenges I faced and how I overcame them:

🎭 Activities section - I was challenged to make a three column section for the top 3 activities. I figured how to do it by setting up a div for each activity and then placing them inside a div, flex container, to display and align them accordingly.

🧑 Guide section - It was hard to format the text elements inside the card 😓. I learned more about using the flex-direction: column to align the elements vertically. Once I figured that out, I used the justify-content to space them out. I tried between the space-between and space-evenly and made final adjustments using the margin property.

This was a challenging yet fun project which made me want to try building my own page with the stretch goals! 🙌 
<ul>
  <li>make your own hometown or country homepage</li>
  <li>use a different color palette</li>
  <li>use Google font</li>
  <li>use :hover</li>
  <li>add whole new section</li>
</ul>
